## Introduction
By now, you have developed a few HTML projects, possibly an ordered list and much more, but there's much more that 
you can accomplish using CSS. We will dive into how web pages are styled using HTML and CSS.

## What is CSS?
To display online pages, browsers mix the content (HTML) with appearance layers (CSS). Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the language we use to style web pages.

CSS instructions are distinct from HTML elements in terms of appearance and feel ("syntax"). CSS directives offer web sites a distinct appearance. If you've ever been impressed by how a website may appear on a desktop browser while looking fantastic on a mobile device, you have CSS to thank for it!

## How does HTML and CSS work together?
Think of **HTML** as your toy room and **CSS** as the paint and stickers you use to decorate it. CSS works by picking specific things (HTML elements) in your toy room and saying, "Let's make this look special!"

For example:
- HTML says, "Here's a box!"
- CSS says, "Let's make the box **blue** and give it a **red border**!"

### HTML and CSS: Two Important Jobs

 **What is HTML? A quick recap**
HTML helps us decide **what goes where** on a webpage. Think of it like building with blocks! We ask ourselves questions like:
- Should I **number** my list or use **dots**?
- Does this **menu** go at the top with the other important things?
- Should this extra note be in its own special section?

> [!note] 
>**HTML is like setting up your toy room!** You're thinking about how everything is organized and what makes sense where.

## What is CSS?
CSS helps us decide **how everything looks**. Imagine you're painting your toy room and choosing where to put decorations. We ask questions like:
- Should the **menu** stay still, or move when you scroll?
- Do we want the text to cover the whole box or leave some **empty space** around it?
- How **big** should the big title be compared to the smaller ones?
- Should the **links** change color when you touch them?

## Declaring Properties and Values

When we use CSS, we make **rules**. These rules have two parts:
1. **Property**: What we want to change (like color or size).
2. **Value**: How we want to change it (like blue or big).

For example:
- If we want our text to be **blue**, the property is `color` and the value is `blue`.
- If we want our box to be **big**, the property is `width` and the value might be `200px` (which means 200 pixels wide).

>Think of it like telling your toys how they should look! You say, "Make this toy **red** and this toy **tall**."





## Summary:
- **CSS** works with HTML by making things look nice, like painting and decorating.
- We tell CSS what to change using **properties** (like color) and how to change it using **values** (like blue).

Now you're ready to start decorating your toy room (webpage) with CSS!
