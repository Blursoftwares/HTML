# Files, Extensions, and File Types

In this section, we’ll learn about **files**, how they’re different, and why **file extensions** are important. Think of files like boxes that hold important information or instructions. These boxes can be opened and used in different ways, depending on what’s inside!

## Objectives

- **Define a file**: What exactly is a file, and how do we use it?
- **Contrast text files and binary files**: What makes these two types of files different?
- **Identify the function of file extensions**: Why do files have different endings like `.txt`, `.jpg`, and `.html`?

## 1. What is a File?

A **file** is like a box that stores data. Just like how you might store toys or crayons in different boxes, a file stores different kinds of information. This information could be **text**, **images**, or **code**! Below is a .docx(this simply means document) file storing a cover letter.

## 2. Text Files vs. Binary Files

Not all files are the same! Files can be sorted into two big groups:

### **Text Files**: 

These are like books full of **letters and numbers**. You can open and read them like a story. Common text files include:

- `favorites.txt`: Stores your favorite songs in plain text.
- `family.html`: Contains instructions for your family's webpage.

### Example:

```txt
Hello, I am a text file!
```
Text files are easy for people to read and understand. You can open a text file in your machine using Notepad, and many more text editors.

## Binary Files
These files store computer code that only machines can read. They are like secret codes for computers. Examples of binary files include:
* `birthday.jpg`: Stores an image of your birthday cake.

* `needforspeed.exe`: Stores Need For Speed, a computer game.

>[!Note]
> You can't read binary files directly, but they help computers do important tasks.

## What Are File Extensions?

A file extension is like a label at the end of a file name that tells us what's inside. It’s made up of a period . followed by letters, like `.txt`, `.jpg`, or `.mp3`.
Below are a few examples of file extensions, how many do you know?

### Why Are File Extensions Important?
* **They tell the computer what to do**: The extension helps the computer know if it should open the file with a text editor, a photo viewer, or another tool.
* **They tell us what kind of file it is**:  We can look at the extension and know if it's a picture, a song, or a document.

> [!note]
> A file extension is a quick and easy way to understand the file's content and purpose without having to open it!

**Examples:**
`.txt`: this is a **text file** for writing your notes.
`.mp3`: this is a **mp3 file**, it contains your favorite song in its audio format.
`.mp4`: this is a **mp4 file**, a video recording of you playing with your pet.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Renaming the file extension does not change the file, `birthday.jpg`(your birthday picture) cannot magically change into a video if you change the file extension to `.mp4`.


## Conclusion
* A file is like a box that stores information.
* Text files are readable by humans (like `.txt`), while binary files are special for computers (like `.jpg`).
* File extensions help both you and your computer know what type of file you're dealing with.    

Now you know how files work and why they have different extensions!
