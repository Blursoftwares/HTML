# How the Web works

Welcome to the web, the largest canvas in the world. Roughly 40% of the world's population has access to the web. Never before has it been possible to reach so many across such vast distances!

To help you get started with your HTML and web programming studies, we'd like to provide you with a general understanding of the web and how it works. While you may have heard the terms "web," "internet," and "server" in a variety of circumstances and settings throughout the years, it is probable that you have never formed a unified mental model that connects those concepts.

In this session, we'll go over the basic steps of how the web operates.

When people share information, amazing things can happen. Politics can change. Our location in the universe can shift. Disease can be conquered. The ability to share knowledge provides power. In the early days of computing, engineers explored for ways to have computers communicate information. Due to technical limitations, networked computers had to be located within the same office.

Eventually, advancements enabled tiny networks to "inter"-"network" with one another. This discipline became known as "internetworking." These small local networks (also known as "local area networks" or LANs) were "internetworked" into "Wide Area Networks" or WANs thanks to "internetworking" technology and understanding.

A certain next step was to "internetwork" WANs into a "larger" inter-network, such as one at the local, country, or global level. The technology for "inter-networking" WANs was difficult and slow to develop, but it eventually resulted in a backbone internetwork, "The Internetwork," which consisted of all of its constituent WANs and LANs. It eventually became known as "the Internet."

It was upon this "The Internet" that "The Web" was built.

## *What makes a Computer a Computer?*

Every machine on the internet is a computer. For the sake of clarity, we'll divide them into two "roles:" client and server. 


## What is a SERVER?*

Historically, a "server" was a larger, more powerful computer with more memory, hard drives, and processors. But today, "server" duties may be fulfilled fairly successfully by Nintendo devices as little as a credit card! Nonetheless, in diagrams and on whiteboards, they are typically depicted as massive "tower-style" computers.

## Who is a CLIENT?*
A computer in a client role is responsible for presenting the data provided from the server. Historically, these devices might be more simply equipped (and thus less expensive). Laptops are commonly represented in diagrams or on whiteboards.

The client shows data sent to it by the server. The verb "render" is often used, as in "The client renders data provided by the server." That is, it only shows server data, and any changes to the data must be made by the server in response to a client request.
